# Troubleshooting

## 1. How to verify if InQuireâ€™s Training function is available:

### A. If Training is available, you will see a welcome screen when you access the Training function.

If you see this page, it means that InQuire is not able to connect to the Training service. Please check that you have completed the following steps.

**Step 1.** Ensure that the VPN is connected to Insyde.

**Step 2.** Contact an Insyde Software sales representative and provide your Google account \(Gmail address\) to apply for authorization. Our training videos utilize the YouTube platform for streaming, so you must provide this information to access these private videos.

**Step 3.** Once your account is authorized, you will receive notification for access to the training course from YouTube.

**Step 4.** Click "Sign in with Google" as shown below.

**Step 5.** Enter your Gmail address and password for Google to complete the registration process for access to the training playlists.

All available training courses should be listed on the left side of the utility and be ready for viewing. If you still cannot access the training course from within InQuire, please contact Insyde Sales for troubleshooting.
