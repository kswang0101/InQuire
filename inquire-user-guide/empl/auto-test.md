# Auto-Test \(for Insyde Software employees only\)

The Auto-Test service page provides a user interface to build BIOS and run auto testing cases on a CRB via H2ORVS. Additional functions include submitting a task that can progress project code analysis in the Klocwork server.

Klocwork can deliver comprehensive source code analysis using static analysis and complete codebase inspection for C++, C, C\# and Java. The following also describes how to use the Klocwork function provided by H2OABT. Please refer to the H2OABT user guide for more details.
