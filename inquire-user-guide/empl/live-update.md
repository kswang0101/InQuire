# Live update

Insyde Live Update helps automatically ensure that all InQuire
utilities are up-to-date via the internet. 
When a new version of an Insyde Software utility is
available, the Insyde Live Update icon will be visible from the
Windows task bar.

When there are available updates, the latest version of InQuire and
other related Insyde tools will be listed within the Insyde Live Update Window.
Select the tools you would like to update, then start the update process by pressing the
"Update" button.
