## Troubleshooting

### 1. How to verify if InQuireâ€™s Training function is available:


#### A. If Training is available, you will see a welcome screen when you access the Training function.

If you see this page, it means that InQuire is not able to connect to
the Training service. Please check that you have completed the
following steps.

**Step 1.** Ensure that the VPN is connected to Insyde.

**Step 2.** Contact an Insyde Software sales representative and
provide your Google account (Gmail address) to apply for
authorization. Our training videos utilize the YouTube platform for
streaming, so you must provide this information to access these
private videos.

**Step 3.** Once your account is authorized, you will receive
notification for access to the training course from YouTube.

**Step 4.** Click "Sign in with Google" as shown below.

**Step 5.** Enter your Gmail address and password for Google to
complete the registration process for access to the training
playlists.

All available training courses should be listed on the left side of
the utility and be ready for viewing. If you still cannot access the
training course from within InQuire, please contact Insyde Sales for
troubleshooting.
