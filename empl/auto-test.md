## Auto-Test (for Insyde Software employees only)

The Auto-Test service page provides a user interface to build BIOS and
run auto testing cases on a CRB via H2ORVS. Additional functions include
submitting a task that can progress project code analysis in the Klocwork server. 

Klocwork can deliver comprehensive source code analysis using static analysis and 
complete codebase inspection for C++, C, C\# and Java.
The following also describes how to use the Klocwork function provided by H2OABT.
Please refer to the H2OABT user guide for more details.
